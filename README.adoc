= Set Lang

* there are two kinds of sets:



comand takes higher priority then alternative:

----
[[c1::cloze::hint||foo||bar]]
----
[[c1::]]

alternative sets

----
[[option 1||[[c2::option 2]]]]
----

the difference is in their default behavior:
.. command sets eval
these can be stacked any way

----
[[c1::[[cloze 1||cloze 2]]::hint]]

[[option 1||[[c1::cloze::hint]]]]
----
