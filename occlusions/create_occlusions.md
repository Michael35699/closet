## Creating occlusions

Ideally, you'd have a GUI to create graphical elements, like image occlusions.
Such an interface is generated by using a special `makeOcclusions` tag.

This will turn each image in the template into their own occlusion interface.

{% include codeDisplay.md content=occlusions.create setups="occlusions" buttons=buttons.frontBack %}
