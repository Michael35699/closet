<b>Closet</b> is a unique mix between a templating engine and a markup language written in TypeScript for the generation of flashcards, especially for the use in the Anki flashcard software.

It allows to use many “effects”, that you’d like to have on flashcards, like shuffling text items, clozes, multiple choice, or image occlusions.

<b>Updates</b>
2020-12-22: v0.3.0 Christmas Update:
BREAKING changes:
- If you use Closet with Asset Manager, Closet will insert a new "Closet Setup" entry into it
  - Simply take the code from your old setup (which is now "loose"), paste it into the new entry
  - Afterwards you can delete your the old ("loose") entry
- If you use Image Occlusion with Closet, you should be careful, when editing the occlusions:
  - Make sure that the field, which is supposed to contain the occlusions has a name which is suffixed with a 0, e.g. "Cmds0", or "Code 0"
  - First turn on the occlusion editor, so that the occlusions are visible on the image
  - Now delete the occlusions in the "Cmds0" field
  - Now accept the occlusions on the image: it should now insert the occlusions wrapped <code>[#!occlusions ...you occlusions... #]</code>

General:
* Support for Windows + AnkiDroid (starting with 2.15alpha17)
* By default, Closet now automatically pastes occlusions into a zero-indexed field, if it exists, rather than copying to clipboard
  * This behavior can be changed in the add-on settings
* As a beta-feature, Closet now hooks on the cloze shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C) for clozes in a Closet-style
  * Add a select input in the toolbar, to configure what this shortcut outputs
  * The toolbar can be set with Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, for different kinds of tags
  * The tag shortcuts respects the semantics of different tags (e.g. `[[c1::` cannot be on a field without a "Code 1" field, but `[[mix1::` can)

Occlusions:
* The occlusion editor will refuse to turn on, if the note type does not support Closet
* You can set the max-height for images in the settings window (in percentage of the screen height)
* Right-click on images, you can resize pictures in the editor
* Trying to close the AddCards window with the occlusion editor open, will inform you to close it first
* Turning on occlusion editor will highlight the icon in the menu
* Make font size of labels dynamic to adjust to image size

2020-11-05: v0.2.3 has MathJax support in Anki
- I improved on the previous approaches, and fixed some long-standing issues, that prevented full MathJax support

2020-11-03: v0.2.2 has experimental MathJax support in Anki
- I removed most of the MathJax support, because it would lead to issues that hide the entire card from displaying in the reviewer

2020-11-02: v0.2.1 has experimental MathJax support in Anki
- To enable it, you need to reinsert Closet using Asset Manager

2020-10-24: v0.2.0 brought some crucial changes with it, which try to make the Closet experience a better one.
- Closet doesn't need Anki Persistence installed anymore
- When opening the Asset Manager window, you will notice a script which says it's "loose". You can simply delete it.
- Closet is now loaded asynchronously, which will increase the performance.

<b>Support</b>
If you like my add-ons, you can consider supporting me. My add-ons will always be freely available for everybody, but what I can offer you is my sincere thanks, and first-hand technical support, if you have any questions/issues with my add-ons. At the same time it allows me to put more time and focus into developing these and making them as powerful and user-friendly as they are. Thanks for considering!
