The first time I wrote code in this vein, I called the script __Multiple Choice__.

Slowly adding functionality, I decided that Multiple Choice didn't quite describe what it did, so I called it __List Randomizer__.

Triggering the mathematican in me, I decided that it should rather be called __Set Randomizer__, because if you randomize elements, the order of the elements is inherently meaningless, unlike a list.

At some point I noticed that using the combination of _thing x_ and "Randomizer" makes Google spout out a lot of videogame randomizers.

Finally, when I rewrote the whole project from scratch, I chose the name __Closet__, because the functionality was **clo**se to **Set**lang, but not quite the same (much better, rather!).
