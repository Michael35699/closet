# The Closet Language

*Closet* is a unique mix between a [templating language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) and a [text formatter]() written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the generation of flashcards, especially for the use in the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard program.

## Why the name?

For this we need to have a short history lesson.

The first time I wrote code in this vain, I called the script __Multiple Choice__.
The only thing it could do is randomize the order of text items.

Slowly adding functionality, I decided that Multiple Choice didn't quite describe what it did.
So I decided it needed a different name, so I called it __List Randomizer__.

Triggering the mathematican in me, I decided that it should rather call it __Set Randomizer__, because if you randomize elements, the order of the elements is inherently meaningless.

At some point I noticed that using the combination of a thing and "Randomizer" makes Google spout out a lot of game randomizers, like "Super Mario Randomizer", which is I slowly started referring to the project as __Setlang__, rather than __Set Randomizer__.

Finally, when I rewrote the whole project from scratch, I chose the name __Closet__, because the functionality was *clo*se to *Set*lang, but not quite the same.
