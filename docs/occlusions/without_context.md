## Occlusions without context

This is a different concept for displaying occlusions dubbed "occlusions without context".
It will completely obscure the image for the front, and highlight the intended section for the back.
It can be useful for things like formula tables.

{% include codeDisplay.md content=occlusions.formulas setups="default_cloze,occlusions_highlight" buttons=buttons.threeCards %}
