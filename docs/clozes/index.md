# What are Clozes?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test):

> A cloze test (also cloze deletion test) is an exercise, test, or assessment consisting of a portion of language with certain items, words, or signs removed (cloze text), where the participant is asked to replace the missing language item.

The rendering of the cloze needs to _context-sensitive_.
Depending on where the cloze is rendered, it needs to be rendered differently:

1. as a _test_, it needs to be rendered as an [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis), or a hint, if one is available
1. as an _answer_, or a _reveal_, it needs to show what was originally hidden

In the context of flashcards, _test_ will be synonmymous with the front of the flashcard, the _answer_ with the back.
