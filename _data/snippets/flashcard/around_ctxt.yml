  [[cr1::Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?[[ctxt::cr*=2]][[up::cr*=1]]]]
  [[cr2::Thou art more lovely and more temperate.]]
  [[cr3::Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,]]
  [[cr4::And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.]]
  [[cr5::Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,]]
  [[cr6::And often is his gold complexion dimmed;]]
  [[cr7::And every fair from fair sometime declines,]]
  [[cr8::By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;]]
  [[cr9::But thy eternal summer shall not fade,]]
  [[cr10::Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,]]
  [[cr11::Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,]]
  [[cr12::When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.]]
  [[cr13::So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,]]
  [[cr14::So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.]]

  -- William Shakespeare, "Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?"
