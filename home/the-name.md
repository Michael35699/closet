The first time I wrote code in this vein, I called the script __Multiple Choice__.

Slowly adding functionality, I decided that Multiple Choice didn't quite describe what it did, so I called it __List Randomizer__.

at some point, I decided that it should rather be called __Set Randomizer__, because if you randomize elements, the order of the elements is inherently meaningless, unlike a list.

Finally, when I rewrote the whole project from scratch, I chose the name __Closet__.
The functionality was **clo**se to **Set**lang, but not quite the same (much better, rather!).
